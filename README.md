LabPtPTm1(Lab dataset series - point to point 815km-SSMF transmission data no. 1)

this dataset is collected in Aug. 2019.

**NOTE**: I have decided to migrate to Zarr for many good reasons. Before DVC is deprecated, you can still use `dvc get` to download the data with additional `--rev 0.1.0` option.
